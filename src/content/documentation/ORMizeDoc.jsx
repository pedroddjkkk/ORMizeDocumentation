      <p>ORMize is a TypeScript-developed Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), but can also be used in JavaScript. Its goal is to ease the interaction between applications and databases, allowing developers to work with data using objects instead of writing SQL code.Currently, ORMize only supports the MySQL database, but I plan to add support for more databases in the future.</p>
